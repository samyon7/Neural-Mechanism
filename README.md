UPDATE:
Transformers got limits, esp. on long reads. They just choke sometimes. One technique, linear attention's a speed hack for attention mechs: kernel trick + recurrence. Faster, less memory, handles longer sequences. Tradeoff? Maybe accuracy dips. Worth it?

Nah, standard softmax attention scales quadratically, right? N-squared complexity kills you for long sequences. Linear attention flips the script, hits you with O(N). Accumulators are the key, fam. Also linear attention enhances Transformer scalability for longer sequences, though optimal performance on specific tasks may necessitate synergistic integration with techniques like sparse attention. Efficient, but additive writes make it prone to memory overflows, which is, like, a real bummer.


Engage with the code, use it in your own agent. Opensource is a real fight
